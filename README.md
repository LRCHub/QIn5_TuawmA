[00:06.71] R.I.P. my enemies, I'll send 'em back to hell
[00:09.38] Fucking with me, bitch, I'll turn that shit to armageddon
[00:10.75] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:18.75] 
[00:12.01] I'm in the AMG, no, bitch, you better not play with me
[00:15.23] This ain't no 50, coming up dizzy, cop the 63
[00:18.22] Wrapped in satin black just like my soul, no holy ghost in me
[00:21.17] Pull up half alive, I feel like dying, what's it gonna be?
[00:24.49] I'm rolling with a boxing blazer, coming for your throat
[00:27.49] Slash 'n' dash and then I fall
[00:28.59] Now you know I want that smoke
[00:30.52] On this road I walk alone
[00:32.33] Can nobody tell me shit, fuck boy
[00:33.58] Got a problem, make it end this quick
[00:35.06] If I die I'm gonna hunt up, pull 'em underground with me
[00:36.44] Six feet deep, I'ma put you there quickly

[01:13.31] Pull out the gun now pulling a blade like it's Dovakhiin in this bitch
[01:16.48] You want some problems, well that's good 'cause I ain't got shit left to live for

[01:25.74] That's the consequences stepping on my deadly territory
[01:29.28] Don't you worry, it'll be swift, my blade like lightning, open a rift

[01:35.46] I-I'm in the AMG, no, bitch, you better not play with me

[01:47.73] I'm rolling with a boxing blazer, coming for your throat
